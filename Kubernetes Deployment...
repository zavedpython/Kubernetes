1. Imperative Mode vs Declarative Mode

a) Imperative Mode : command line mode
b) Declerative Mode: File/Manifests method..(.yaml)



what are the projects/namespaces...

1. It provide resource(pods) isolation (hide) between teams..
2. using the projects multiple team can work in the same without conflicts.
3. we can provide user access over the project. (view edit or full access): RBAC
4. we can align CPU/MEM/Storage quota. (compute quota)


create  # kubectl create ns <name>
list    # kubectl get ns
use	# kubectl get pod -n <name>
delete	# kubectl delete ns <name>






kubectl create ns rbl  # this is to create projects.
kubectl delete ns rbl
kubectl run test --image=nginx -n rbl

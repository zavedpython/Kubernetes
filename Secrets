Kubernetes Secrets    > In Kubernetes, a Secret is an object that stores sensitive information such as:

Passwords
OAuth tokens
SSH keys
API keys

Unlike ConfigMaps, Secrets are specifically designed for confidential data, keeping it separate from application code and environment variables.
Secrets are base64-encoded in Kubernetes, not encrypted by default.

Secrets are stored in the Kubernetes API server.

Pods can consume secrets in two ways:
1. As environment variables
2. As mounted volumes
The kubelet fetches the secret and injects it into the pod at runtime.

Secrets are namespaced. A Secret in one namespace cannot be accessed by a pod in another namespace unless RBAC allows it.

Types of secrets

1- genric               # It used for tokcer/ssh keys/ password etc.. 
2- tls                  # It use to store SSL certificates.
3- docker-registries    # It is used for docker registry authintication in pulling images.

1. Pod IPs
2. Pod A to Pod communication (same host & remote Host)
3. Pod communication to  infra network ( outside the cluster )

Networking:
  1. Physical
  2. Software define network.

Noted: Pod network works CNI(container network  interface) concept. CNI: it  is software define  network  network solution.
CNI Solution list .
1. flannel
2. weave
3. ovn-kubernetes
4. calico 


By default  kubernetes we  prefered  calico  CNI.

1. it is software define network solution.
2. it provide L-3 Networking  function.
3. it also provide BGP based routing . 
4. we can configure network security  (ACL).

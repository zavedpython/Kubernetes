In Kubernetes (K8s), namespaces are a way to divide cluster resources between multiple users, teams, or applications. They provide logical isolation within the same cluster. Think of namespaces as "virtual clusters" inside a single physical cluster.

Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

Purpose of Namespaces
  Resource isolation: Multiple teams can work in the same cluster without interfering with each other.
  Access control: You can apply Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to namespaces.
  Resource quotas: Limit resources (CPU, memory, etc.) for a particular namespace.
  Organization: Easier management of resources by grouping related objects.

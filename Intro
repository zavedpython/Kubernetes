Kubernetes (K8s) is an open-source container orchestration platform developed by Google and now maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF). 
It helps automate the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

ðŸ”§ What Kubernetes Does:
Orchestrates Containers: Manages Docker or other container runtimes.
Self-Healing: Restarts failed containers, replaces them, and kills unresponsive ones.
Auto-Scaling: Automatically scales applications up or down based on usage.
Load Balancing: Distributes traffic across containers to ensure reliability.
Rolling Updates & Rollbacks: Updates applications without downtime and reverts if needed.
Resource Management: Ensures efficient use of CPU, memory, and other resources.

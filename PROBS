Kubernetes Probes --    Kubernetes uses probes to monitor the health of containers inside Pods.

Probe Type	
1.  Liveness Probe:    Checks if the container is still running properly. If it fails, K8s restarts the container.	Detect deadlocks or hung processes.
2.  Readiness Probe:   Checks if the app is ready to serve traffic. If it fails, traffic is not sent to the Pod.	Delay traffic until app startup completes.
3.  Startup Probe:     Used to delay other probes until startup completes. Prevents killing slow-starting apps.	For apps that take time to initialize (e.g., Java, large Flask apps).


ðŸ§© Common Probe Configuration Example

livenessProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /health
    port: 8080
  initialDelaySeconds: 10
  periodSeconds: 10
  failureThreshold: 3

readinessProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /ready
    port: 8080
  initialDelaySeconds: 5
  periodSeconds: 5

startupProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /startup
    port: 8080
  failureThreshold: 30
  periodSeconds: 10


So â€” which one are we tackling: probes concept/configuration or troubleshooting problems?

### orphan PODS and NAME SPACE#########

#orphan pod means which are not created by any controller such as replicaton controller and replicaset controller and deployment controller. we wills see these controller in next sessions.

#running first container, by deault every pods goes under "default" namespace. Name space is nothing just a project name.
kubectl run test –image=docker.io/nginx

#get details of running pod
kubectl get pod

#get depth details of running pod
kubectl get pod -o wide

#get pod details from specific namespace. in following example we are looking pods details running in kube-system name space.
kubectl get pod -n kube-system

#getting details of name spaces 
kubectl get ns

#create new namespace with name webporod in kubernetes cluster
kubectl create ns webprod

#deploy new pod with name demo in namespace webprod
kubectl run demo --image=docker.io/nginx -n webprod
kubect get pod -n webprod

# delete webprod ns from kubernets cluster
kubectl delete ns webprod

#command to see logs of pod
kubectl logs <name of pod>

#how to go inside the pod.
kubectl exec -it <podname> /bin/bash

#how to see depth detail of pod
kubect describe pod <podname>

#delete a pod 
kubectl delete pod <podname>

#To see all pods running for all namespace
kubectl get pod -A
kubectl get pod --all-namespaces|wc -l


##Lab 2: creation of pods using yaml( in below example we are running two containers inside on pod)
#save file with name pod-2con.yaml

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: webserver
spec:
  containers:
  - name: webserver
    image: nginx:latest
    ports:
    - containerPort: 80
  - name: webwatcher
    image: afakharany/watcher:latest

#create pods using above yaml file
kubectl create -f pod-2con.yaml

#if we want to apply change of yamal file
kubectl apply -f pod-2con.yaml

#delete pods using yamal
kubectl delete -f pod-2con.yaml

#creating yaml file using dry run option
kubectl run demo --image=docker.io/nginx --dry-run -o yaml > nginx.yaml

# Command to see kubernetes resources
kubectl api-resources

# to see what terms comes in yaml file in kind of Pod.
kubectl explain pod
kubectl explain pod.spec


####Replication Controller###########
pod state maintain
scalability
high availbility


## Make a file with name repicationController.yaml with following content
apiVersion: v1
kind: ReplicationController
metadata:
  name: amartest
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    app: nginx

  template:
    metadata:
      name: nginx
      labels:
        app: nginx

    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx

#Crease pods using repication controller
kubectl create -f repicationController.yaml

#command to check repication controller and check the pods details
kubectl get rc
kubectl get pod -o wide

##Scale  out the pods
kubectl scale --replicas=4 rc amartest

## Scale in the pod
kubectl scale --replicas=3 rc amartest

#you can edit repication controller directory in cluster
kubectl edit rc amartest

#whatif you set replicaset value 0. In this case rc will remain but pod will be demolished. 
kubectl scale --replicas=0 rc amartest
kubectl get rc
kubectl get pod

# which command can put autoscale pods using replication controller on behalf of cpu utilzation, this command can be much useful when you get to know how to allocate cpu and ram on pods and namesapce.

kubectl autoscal rc amartest --max=10 --min=3 --cpu=80
kubectl get hpa


#what is selector and labels

labes in case of pod( this is used to categoriezed pods according to label, in pod we can give multiple label to single pod.
=========================================================================================================================
a. yaml for frontend web

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
   labels:
	tier:frontend
   name:web
spec:
   containers:
    -image: nginx

b.yaml for backend web
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
   labels:
	tier:backend
   name:db
spec:
   containers:
    -image: nginx
    -name:mysql
    ports:
      - containerPort: 80

after run both yaml file using command.. kubectl create -f < yaml file>
kubectl get pod
kubctl get pod --show-lables
kuberctl get pod -l tier=frontend
kubectl get pod -l tier=backend
kubectl delete pod -l tier=frontend
kubectl delete pod -l tier=backend
kubectl delete pod --all


##### label in replication controllers############
in replication label should define under template's metadata section.... and it should call in selector to crreate replicas of pods using replication controller


## replication yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ReplicationController
metadata:
  name: amartest
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    app: nginx ( Replication controller will communicate with all pods which will have same label)

  template:
    metadata:
      name: nginx
      labels:
        app: nginx  ( this is the label for pod in repication controller file)

    spec:   ( in this section we defined container based options)
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx
      ports:
        - containerPort: 80


kubectl create -f replication.yaml
kubectl get pod ( see the labels, should same for all)
kubectl delete pod < podname>
kubectl delete rc amartest
kubectl get pod
# command to get event logs of pod
kubectl get events |grep  <podnane>
# command to see controller of pod
kubectl describe pod|grep -i controll

###################ReplicaSet########################
ReplicaSet replaced replication controller in industry. in yaml file we will change kind type to Replicaset.. this will mange pod which will have labesl frontend

## replicaset yaml

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: ReplicaSet
metadata:
  name: frontend
  labels:
    app: guestbook
    tier: frontend
spec:
  # modify replicas according to your case
  replicas: 3
  selector:

      tier: frontend
  
template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        tier: frontend
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: php-redis
        image: gcr.io/google_samples/gb-frontend:v3

#yaml 2########### this yamal is set based slector.. like replicaset mnaging pods which will have labes prod and frontend
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: ReplicaSet
metadata:
     name:frontend
     labels:
       app:guestbook
       tier:frontend

    selector:
      matchExpression:
         -key: tier
          operator: In
          values:

       env:prod
spec:
   containers:
       -name:php-redis
       image:gcr.io/google_samples/gb-frontend:v3


# command to see the replicaset
kubect get rs

#command to scale-in  and scale-out for replicatset
kubectl scale --replicas=4 rs amartestrs
kubectl scale --replicas=2 rs amartestrs


#Diffence between RC (replication controller)and RS ( replicaset)

*Replication controller work on equality based selector
* Replica Set work on set base selectors as well on quality base selector.












Note: if we already launched a pod which have same labels which we defined in replication controller then replication controller will less that no of pod from defined replicas, suppose you defined 3 repicase in repplication yaml file and we launched one pod manullay using same label which we we gave in yaml, then repication  controller will deploy 2 pod instead of 3.
 
##Note: If any pod goes down or delete in case replication controller launch new one itself because its maintain the state of pods.





### Rollout and Rollback##################### using Deployment controller##################

This rollout and rollback term is used to apply changes on running application. Suppose if we want to apply latest version with some changes on running applcation so this method is called rollout. If any case new changes will not work properly then we will go back on on old version so this method is called rollback. This process can be done with zero timeout.
 
for example: nginx:1.18 to nginx:1.19

Note: using RC and RS you can maintain same version of application, but you can't rollout and rollback.
Deployment controller: this controller have all feature of RS and RC and apart of this this have rollout and rollback feature. In production we use deployment controller instead of RC and RS. this also provide scalability and replication maintain feature. 

Deployment Stategy:--
1a) rolling update.. This is default. this will create 25% of pods from running pod and then remove 25 % from running pods.
1b) recrete

a. write a deployment.yaml file with following content

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment
  labels:
    app: nginx
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:1.14.2
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80

##deployment command
kubectl create -f deployment.yaml
kubectl get deploy
kubectl scale --replicas=4 deploy nginx-deployment(name of deployment)
kubectl scale --replicas=2 deploy nginx-deployment(name of deployment)
kubectl get pod
kubectl delete pod < podname>
kubectl get pod
kubectl delete deploy nginx-deployment
kubectl describe deploy nginx-deployment |grep -i max
kubectl get deploy nginx-deployment -o yaml|grep -i grace
#above command will show unavaiable and surge percentage of pods. which is default is 25%. Grace period by default is 30 sec.

Note: kube-proxy is l3 load balncer which we will study during network study.

#rolling update
kubectl describe deploy nginx-deployment|grep -i image ( command to check running version of app)
kubectl rollout history deploy nginx-deployment (command to check any rollout or change goes to runnning pod in deployment)
kubectl set image deploy nginx-deployment nginx=nginx:1.20 ( this command is used to send change of application version in running pod using deployment controller)
kubectl set image deploy nginx-deployment nginx=nginx:1.20 --record ( this record is used to make history of command of deployment)
kubectl set image deploy nginx-deployment nginx=nginx:1.21 --record
kubectl rollout history deploy nginx-deployment

#rollback
kubectl rollout undo deploy nginx-deployment --to-version=1 ( this version we can see from history version)
kubectl describe deploy nginx-deployment |grep -i image

# manually method to create deployment
kubectl create deploy  test --image=nginx

##edit max surge and  maxUnavailable default value in deployment by edit existing deployment,or if you want to change deployment type which are RollingUpdate and Recreate.
kubectl edit deploy nginx-deployment 


### Resource and Compute Quota in kubernets##########
Earlier whatever method we had learn to launcg pods, those dont have limit of utilization of CPU and RAM by pods in kubernetes, now we will se how can we allocate cpu and memory to a pod and on a name space.

There are two types of quota in kubernets 
a.compute quota: Restricted usage of  cpu/memory for containers/pods.
b. Resource quota/Objective quota: set limitation on  pod,replication controller,replicaset,deployment and all resource which are comes under kubernetes( kubectl  api-resources).

===> we know one cpu have 1000 micro so unit in kubernets for cpu is m .
==> unit for RAM is Gi(KB), Mi(MB),Gi(GB)


Compute-Quota on ( deployment/replicaset/replication controller
==============
1: level:
 a. deployment level (simple pod/ through controller)
 b. namespace/project level
suppose we have a project with name QA where we alloted 10 GB RAM and 4 micro cpus,this will limit the resource limit for team who is working in this project or namespace. and if we allotes quota on pods then its called deployment level quota. Types of compute quota are request and limit.

###example1: how to create pod with compute quota##
kubectl run test --image=nginx --dry-run -o yaml > resourcepod.yml

vim resourcepod.yaml ( add following lines in container specificaions)

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name:test

spec:
   containers:
	- image:nginx
          name:test
          resources:
             requests: ( this is gaurantee memory which assign during pod creation)
		 memory:200Mi
                 cpu:200m
             limits:
                 memory:400Mi
		 cpu:300m
		 ( this is the limit of pod for memory allocation, above this pod can't use in any case). But this not gaurntee memory, this will assign 			to pod in case node will have remain memory. 

#command to know the free memory of worker node
kubectl get node worker1.example.com |grep -iA5 allocated
kubectl create -f resourcepod.yaml
kubectl get pod test -o wide ( to check the node name where pod is deployed in cluster)
kubectl describe node worker1.example.com |grep -iA5 allocated
kubectl get events |grep demo(podname)

##if you only define the only limit in yamal then  it will take limits as request as well. see following example

vim onlylimit.yaml

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name:demo

spec:
   containers:
	- image:nginx
          name:test
          resources:
              limits:
                 memory:400Mi
		 cpu:300m

#kubectl create -f onlylimit.yaml
#kubectl describe pod demo|less

#limit cpu and ram in replication.yaml file
apiVersion: v1
kind: ReplicationController
metadata:
  name: nginx
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      name: nginx
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
	resources:
	  requests:
             cpu:200m
             memory: 200Mi
          limits:
		cpu:300m
		memory:300Mi

#kubectl create -f replication.yaml
#kubectl get pod
#kubectl describe pod podname|less
#kubectl delete replication.yaml

###note: in a same way you can define quota on replicaset and deployment as you did in repplication controller.

##APLLY QUOTA on PROJECT and NAME SPACE####
kubectl create ns webprod
kubectl get quota -n webprod
kubectl create quota webprodnamespacequota --hard=memory=400Mi,cpu=400m -n webprod
kubectl get quota -n webprod

vim pod.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name:demo
spec:
   containers:
	- image:nginx
          name:test
          resources:
              limits:
                 memory:200Mi
		 cpu:200m

kubectl create -f pod.yaml -n webprod
kubectl describe quota webprodnamespacequota -n webprod
#command to edit quota of a namespace
kubectl edit quota webprodnamespacequota

#note: if we set the quota limit on a name space as set in above commands, after that can't launch any orphan pod inside name space without defining cpu and memory limit.

LimitRange: this is also a method in compute resource, by using this we can set minimum and maximum cpu and ram limit during launching pod. This is also one of kind like deployment, replication controller and replica-set.
a. default value can be inject in pod
b. user will restrict to define resource above or less( define in Limit Range)


vim limitrange.yaml

apiVersion: v1
kind: LimitRange
metadata:
  name: cpu-min-max-demo-lr
spec:
  limits:
  - max:
      cpu: "800m"
      memory: "400Mi"
    min:
      cpu: "200m"
      memory: "300Mi"
    type: Container

#kubectl create namespace weblimitrange
#kubectl create -f limitrange.yaml -n weblimitrange ( if you will not specify namespace in this command then this limitrange will apply on default namespace).
#kubectl delete -f limitrange.yaml

##### Resource Quota######
when we want to set limitation on deployment,replication controller and replicaset then resource quota comes in picture. it alwasy implement on project or namespace.

examples:
kubectl create ns qa
kubectl create quota qateam --hard=pods=10,services=5,deployment=15,memory=1000Mi,cpu=400m ( set the limit of diffent resources, you can also include compute resource as well)
kubectl describe quota qateam -n qa



############# Pod Scheduling and NodeName Based#################

Previously we have created many pods in kubernets cluster using diffrent type of method such as orphan pod,deployment,replicaset, replication controller but in all these case we don't have controll about on which node pod should be create in cluster. In scheduling we will create pod on specific node where we want to.

benifits:
1.protect from resource crunch
2. protect from eviction of running pod
3. protect from downtime due to eviction on prod.


######Rules for custom scheduling################
a. NodeName Base Pod scheduling ( no dependency on Scheduler in cluster).
b.Node label and Selector Base scheduling
c. Taint and tolerations
d. Affinity and anti-affinity


a. NodeName base Pod scheduling ( in this method you can put only one node, so high avaialbity is in red zone in case node goes down)

1. example of normal pod: crate a yaml using nodeName option in spec tag.
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx
spec:
  nodeName: worker1.example.com
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx:1.14.2
    ports:
    - containerPort: 80
#kubectl create -f pod.yaml


2.example of deployment yaml

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment
  labels:
    app: nginx
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      nodeName: worker2.example.com	
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:1.14.2
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80

#kubectl create -f deploy.yaml
kubectl edit deploy nginx-deployment ( this command to edit the deployment)
#kubectl get componentstatuses ( this command is used to check health of cluster components such asetcd, and schedulers)
#ps -ef |grep api or #lsof -i tcp:6443
#kubectl get pod -n kube-system
#kubectl get pod -o wide

#Node Label and Selector Based Scheduling.#####
In this method we gives labeling on nodes and during deployment we need this label as selector for deploying pod on match nodes. we can give same label on multiple node and multiple labels on single node. In this case we used NodeSelector: method during deployment.

Benifits: 
a. High Availbility
b. Protect us from resource crunch.
c. Deployed pods which match labels given in NodeSelector during deployment and labeling to node ( these key/value should same).

example: in following example will give compute=db label to worker1, worker2 and worker3( will change it label in next step) and after that will use NodeSelector: method during deployment.

#kubectl label node worker1.example.com compute=db
#kubectl label node worker2.example.com compute=db
#kubectl lael node worker3.example.com compute=db

Note: you can overwrite existing label for a particular node. suppose I want to change label of worker3, then use following command with --overwrite option.
#kubectl label node worker3.example.com  compute=app --overwrite

#command to know label given on nodes.
kubectl get nodes --show-labels
kubectl get node -L compute ( to see the value of key compute)
kubectl get node -L compute=db ( it will see node name which have label compute=db)
kubectl get node -L compute=app ( it will see node name which have label compute=app)
you can change the label on fly..
kubectl edit node worker1.example.com

###deployment using labels which we gave in above command##########

vim deployment.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment
  labels:
    app: nginx
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      nodeSelector: ( this is use of nodeSelctor)
         compute:db 	( this is the label of node which we gave in above commands)		
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:1.14.2
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80

#kubectl create -f deployment.yml
#kubectl get pod -o wide

###Scheduling on NameSpace
label = disk=ssd
kubectl label node worker1.example.com disk=ssd ( labeling node1 with label disk=ssd)
vim /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml ( PodNodeSelector option is not provided for name space by api server, we need to enable this feaature in api first)
--enable-admission-plugins=NodeRestriction,PodNodeSelector ( save and quit)

kubectl create deploy web --image=nginx -n dev

kubectl edit namespace dev (after enable PodNodeSelector option in API as given in above step edit namespace, undermetadata section put following parameter)

annotations:
  scheduler.alpha.kubernetes.io/node-selector: disk=ssd ( save and quit)

kubectl create deploy web --image=nginx -n dev
kubectl create deploy app --image=nginx -n dev
kubectl create deploy app --image=nginx -n dev
kubectl get po -o wide -n dev

##NOTE: In   nodeSelector method it will launch your pod on specific worker node but that not means other deployment will not come on this worker node.  If you want to prohibited other deployment on that node then you need to go for taint and toleration method of scheduling.

##Taint and Toleration scheduling############

In taint and toleration method we prevent other deployment on specific worker. worker node will only accept those deployment which torelation label with its taint label.
Tent applied on worker and tolreations used in deployment.

##taint apply on worker node#########
kubeclt taint node worker2.example.com color=green=NoSchedule
## Remove Taint using minus (-) sign
kubeclt taint node worker2.example.com color=green=NoSchedule-
kubeclt taint node worker2.example.com app=monitoring=NoSchedule

vim Pod.yaml

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx
spec:
  ####################
 tolerations:
	- key:app
          operator:Equal ( if operator is equal then value should define but if you use operator as Exists then value is not neccessary to define)
          value:monitoring
	  effect:NoSchedule
or

 tolerations:
	- key:app
          operator:Exists (  if you use operator as Exist then value is not neccessary to define)
          effect:NoSchedule
########################

  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx:1.14.2
    ports:
    - containerPort: 80


### Taint-Effect-Type#####
NoSchedule: This not evict running pod(dont have torations) on worker node, which is launched before implement taint rule
NoExecute: it doesnt allow. It will evict all running pod from worker node which launch before taint rule. but when will implement taint rule it will delete all            running pod which will not have matched tolreations.
NoPrefered: This is soft type taint, if you launch a pod without tolretations and this pod could not find essesntials compute resources then, worker which have soft taint rule and have compute resource can allow this pod to on same worker node.



NETWORKKING
===========
In this section we will see how network things works in kubernetes cluster. In our case we will use Calico network as this is mostly used in production environment.
Pod Network works on CNI(container network interface) concept, its kind of sofware define network which provide OSI model's L3 capacity such as routing and policies.
There are multiple flavor for CNI such as flannel,Calico. Calico is recommended in production environment.Calico has been configured with a subnet pool. Calico work on  CISCO BGP protocol.

1. Pod should have unique IP address ( default its assign)
2. Two pod should be communicate to each other on same worker. (Default its communicate)
3.Two pod shouold be communicate to each other on different workers( remote containers). (Default Network allow)

#####Installation calico network during kubernetes clsuster setup####
curl https://docs.projectcalico.org/manifests/calico.yaml -O 
vim calico.yaml ( and put following parameters for default cidr and block size)

#####installation link of calicoctl command ###
https://github.com/xxradar/k8s-calico-oss-onprem-install

- name: CALICO_IPV4POOL_CIDR ( you can search this string in file during editing)
  value: "192.168.0.0/24"
- blockSize: 26

kubectl apply -f calico.yaml

Note: Above both commands will run on master node, and API will deploy calico networ by running one pod on worker nodes including master node. you can check using following command.
#kubectl get pod -n kube-system|grep calico-node

###commands to check configred subnet pool##############
calicoctl get ipPool ( by default calicoctl command not comes, we need to install this manually)
calicoctl ipam show ( this command will show whole subnet)
calicoctl ipam show --show-blocks ( this command will show whole subent as well blocks also as devided by controller for all nodes running in kubernetes cluster)
kubectl get IpPool
kubectl describe IpPool default-ipv4-ippool

####command to make yaml file for cofiguring new pool#####
kubectl get IpPool default-ipv4-ippool -o yaml > ippool.yaml  ===after that you can make changes and deploy new network pool
calicoctl get IpPool -o yaml > ippool.yaml( this command will show the output of default network pool's yaml format)

Note: By default calico network works on ipip mode , you can see following parameters in calico.yaml file
-name: CALICO_IPV4POOL_IPIP
 value: "Always" =====( if you want to use tunnel mode then change this value to Never)

##command to reset kubernetes cluster####
kubectl reset -f ( be conscious before run this command)
kubectl get crd |grep calico ( to see the resorces of calico existing on cluster)


##################Service IP for PODS#############
All we know when we launch pods using RC,RS and deployment every pod get one uniqe ip address. But think what happend if any pod goes down because of an error and when comes again,its ip address would not be same, so for come out from this issue Service IP comes in picture. It never been changed. This service ip can be used to go outside from existing network. This is the static endpoint for pods and make the connection persistent.

features of Service IP
#####################
1.it is static ip for deployment
2.service Ip also use diffrent pool network
3.Service IP Reserved IP address for deployment manage by kube-proxy.
4. Kube-proxy is like software define frontend blancer/proxy for your pod.
5.Service ip work with kube-proxy so its also provide loadbalancer.

# command to expose your deployment on port 80. in following command we will expose test deployment on port 80 get a service ip with name db.
1.kubectl create deploy test --image=nginx
2. kubectl expose deploy test --port=80 --name=db ( if not define target ports then it will take backend port default as target port)
kubectl expose deploy test --name=db --port=8080( this is frontend port) --target-port=80( this is backend port)
3. kubectl get service ( command for ckecking service ip with name db on cluster level).
4. kubectl descibe service db|grep -i end ( it will show the ip address attached of pods which are launched during deployment test, if any pod will stop and start end point will change automatically)
5. kubectl delete deploy test
6.kubectl delete service db

Note: If you delete your deployment named test and deploy an orphan container with label test then that orphan pod will reclaim this service IP. If we deleted deployment and pod service ip will be remain on clusetr and other resource can recalim service ip. This all happend becasue service ip used selector to match labels.

###Service IP Types###
ref link: https://medium.com/devops-mojo/kubernetes-service-types-overview-introduction-to-k8s-service-types-what-are-types-of-kubernetes-services-ea6db72c3f8c
1.ClusterIP
===========
.ClusterIP is the default and most common service type.
.Kubernetes will assign a cluster-internal IP address to ClusterIP service. This makes the service only reachable within the cluster.
.You cannot make requests to service (pods) from outside the cluster.
.You can optionally set cluster IP in the service definition file.
###Use Cases####
Inter service communication within the cluster. For example, communication between the front-end and back-end components of your app.

###Example###
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-backend-service
spec:
  type: ClusterIP # Optional field (default)
  clusterIP: 10.10.0.1 # within service cluster ip range
  ports:
  - name: http
    protocol: TCP
    port: 80
    targetPort: 8080




2.NodePort
==========
a. NodePort service is an extension of ClusterIP service. A ClusterIP Service, to which the NodePort Service routes, is automatically created.
b. It exposes the service outside of the cluster by adding a cluster-wide port on top of ClusterIP.
c. NodePort exposes the service on each Node’s IP at a static port (the NodePort). Each node proxies that port into your Service. So, external traffic has access to d. fixed port on each Node. It means any request to your cluster on that port gets forwarded to the service.
e. You can contact the NodePort Service, from outside the cluster, by requesting <NodeIP>:<NodePort>.
f. Node port must be in the range of 30000–32767. Manually allocating a port to the service is optional. If it is undefined, Kubernetes will automatically assign one.
g. If you are going to choose node port explicitly, ensure that the port was not already used by another service.

###Use Cases##
a.When you want to enable external connectivity to your service.
b.Using a NodePort gives you the freedom to set up your own load balancing solution, to configure environments that are not fully supported by Kubernetes, or even to c.expose one or more nodes’ IPs directly.
d. Prefer to place a load balancer above your nodes to avoid node failure.

###example###
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-frontend-service
spec:
  type: NodePort
  selector:
    app: web
  ports:
  - name: http
    protocol: TCP
    port: 80
    targetPort: 8080
    nodePort: 30000 # 30000-32767, Optional field

example 2:
kubectl create deploy test --image=nginx
kubect expose deploy test --port=80 --type=NodePort
kubectl get service ( you will see a node port will allocate which will forward traffic on port 80)
netstat -tlnp|grep <nodeport>

you can access pod service using worker ip address:port from out side of the world.

Note: you can expose pod service using ingress controller also to outside world....


3.LoadBalancer
===============
a.LoadBalancer service is an extension of NodePort service. NodePort and ClusterIP Services, to which the external load balancer routes, are automatically created.
b. It integrates NodePort with cloud-based load balancers.
c. It exposes the Service externally using a cloud provider’s load balancer.
d. Each cloud provider (AWS, Azure, GCP, etc) has its own native load balancer implementation. The cloud provider will create a load balancer, which then automatically e. routes requests to your Kubernetes Service.
f. Traffic from the external load balancer is directed at the backend Pods. The cloud provider decides how it is load balanced.
g. The actual creation of the load balancer happens asynchronously.
h. Every time you want to expose a service to the outside world, you have to create a new LoadBalancer and get an IP address.

###Use Cases###
When you are using a cloud provider to host your Kubernetes cluster.This type of service is typically heavily dependent on the cloud provider.

###Example#####

apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-frontend-service
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  clusterIP: 10.0.171.123
  loadBalancerIP: 123.123.123.123
  selector:
    app: web
  ports:
  - name: http
    protocol: TCP
    port: 80
    targetPort: 8080


4.ExternalName
==============
a.Services of type ExternalName map a Service to a DNS name, not to a typical selector such as my-service.
b.You specify these Services with the `spec.externalName` parameter.
c.It maps the Service to the contents of the externalName field (e.g. foo.bar.example.com), by returning a CNAME record with its value.
d.No proxying of any kind is established.

###Use Cases###
a.This is commonly used to create a service within Kubernetes to represent an external datastore like a database that runs externally to Kubernetes.
b.You can use that ExternalName service (as a local service) when Pods from one namespace to talk to a service in another namespace.

###Example####
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-service
spec:
  type: ExternalName
  externalName: my.database.example.com

############### END integration  of two tier application#################


######### NETWORK POLICIES##############################################
Even if pods are running in isolated name space but there are on single network, they can communicate to each other. If hacker reached to single pod then he can breach to any pod. To secure this thing we need to implement pod level firewall that is called network policy. This is inter between pod security. There is another kind is NetworkPolicy which is use to implement inter pod security. There is only way through yaml to implement this because till yet there is no command available.

Traffic rule tyeps
1.ingress ( inbound network)--allowincoming traffic.
2. Egress (outbond network)-- allow outgoing traffic.

There can be three criteria for writing rules.
a. Source address
b. namespace label
c. pod label

above criteria work in two format that are following.
1. and format ( all criteria should match for traffinc allow)
2. or format ( any one criteria should match for traffic allow)

example lab
in same name space there are three pods(web/db/app)
$db should be allow only from app
=================================
kubectl delete deploy --all --force
kubectl delete pod --all
kubectl run web --image=nginx
kubectl run db --image=nginx
kubectl run app --image=nginx

kubectl get pod --show-labels
###in output section you will notice labels and ip address of pods which you created. 

vim policy-db-app.yaml

Example2:
diffrent pod in diffrent name space
db should communicate only from app pods.
##############
kubectl run app --image=nginx -n webprod -l env:webprod ( you can give label to name space by edit namespace using following command)
kubectl edit ns webprod ( and can set same label env:webprod)

vim policy-db-app1.yaml

apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: db-app1
  namespace: default-----always put the namespace same where your pods are running.

        matchLabels:
          run: app
	 namespaceSelector:  
		env:webprod
        
	- namespaceSelector:  (condition2-- if we put - before nameSpaceSelector that means it will work on or format). if not then will use and conditions.)
	   matchLabels:
		env:webprod
    ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80

kubectl create -f policy-db-app1.yaml

kubectl exec -it  app -n webprod /bin/bash
curl <db-ip> --- it should work( becasue both conditions (namespace and pod labels) matched in policy)

kubectl exec -it app /bin/bash
curl <dbip> -- it should not work becasue ( pod label matched but namespace label not matched in policy)



######### PERSISTANCE VOLUME IN KUBERNETES########################
Normally we know if we create the pod in kubernets,doesnt have persitance volume by default,so if we will make change in pod, and if that goes down and will bring up data will lost, so preventing loss of data VLOUME came in picture.


Volume Resource API

1. PVC( persistant volume claim) - we need to claim volume using PVC through Resouce API. It is requested by administrator for external volume
2. PV ( persistant volume): it is available in cluster level which provide by storage for kubernetes cluster.

pod-->pvc-->Bond PVP-->storage Server

Volume Provisioning
-------------------
a.static
b.dynamic

if pvc deleted then what happen to PV? its depend what persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy we give duing PV cration. which are following:
1.recycle- data lost but pv is avaiable for other.
2.retain- data+ pv both avaiable for same pod which will come up again
3. Deletes: pvc delete the pv will also deleted.

#####Lab1:  static provisioning ####### we cant expand volume in static provisioning..####################
1. Make nfs server and make & share a directory /data/exports/ and ip address of nfs is 192.168.30.35
2. kubectl create deploy test --image=nginx 
make change is inside pod
3.kubectl get pod -o wide
4.kubecrl delete pod <podname>
new pod will launch and data will lose.
5. make PVC using pvc.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: myclaim--- this name should be uniq
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteMany
  volumeMode: Filesystem
  storageClassName: slow-- this classs should should be avaiable in pv yaml in our case nfs.yaml.
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 5Gi
#kubectl crreate -f pvc.yaml
#kubectl get pvc
NOte: if status is showing in pending,,that means its not claim by PV.

6. make nfs.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: pv0003
spec:
  capacity:
    storage: 5Gi
  volumeMode: Filesystem
  accessModes:

  mountOptions:
    - hard
    - nfsvers=4.1
  nfs:
    path: /data/exports
    server: 192.168.30.35
#kubectl create -f pv.yaml
#kubectl get pv
#kubectl get pvc

#Now use the PV in deployment's pod.. so write one deployment.yaml

################## DEPLOYMENT USING HELM###############################

HELM INSTALLATION
curl -fsSL -o get_helm.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helm/helm/master/scripts/get-helm-3
chmod +x get_helm.sh
./get_helm.sh
helm

What is Helm?
HELM is  a package manager in kubernetes cluster, its have following features.
1.Deployment creation
2.Upgration
3.rollback
4.deletion


Helm chart: This is bundel which have installation files. this is two types, custom and cummunity.


custom chart
=============
#kubectl create ns webprod1
#helm create nginx ( this will create nginx helm chart files)
#cd nginx
#ls 
Note: template folder and values.yaml very important. template holds all menifests such as deployment,quota,replicaset and replication controller,service account,rbac and etc.
# modify values.yaml file and pass your values as per your requirement... after that run following command
#helm install krnetwork nginx<name of helm chart which we created> -n webprod1<namespace>
#helm list -n webprod1 ( list the name of deployment in webprod1 namespace)
# run  following command after modify the values in value.yaml file.
helm upgrade krnetwork nginx -n webprod1
helm delete krnetwork -n webprodq ( delete the all deployment in one go)
kubectl get all -n webprod1

#command to check rollout history.
kubectl rollout history deploy krnetwork-nginx(deployment name)
## command to rollback deployment using helm command
helm rollback krnetwork -n webprod1
#helm uninstall krnetwork -n webprod1


######communities helm chart#########

example: installation of mysql
#helm repo list
#helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami
#helm repo list
#helm search repo bitnami(name of repo)
#helm install mysql-deployment(name) bitnami/mysql -n webprod1 ( this will deploy with all pre-existing value, if you want to deploy with your values, then pull it)
#helm uninstall mysql-deployment -n webprod1
#cd .cache/helm/repository/
#cp -av mysql-8.8.20.tgz /tmp/
#cd /tmp
#tar xvf mysql-8.8.20.tgz
cd mysql-8.8.20
vim values.yaml
helm install mysql bitnami/mysql -n webprod1 -f /tmp/mysql-8.8.20/values.yaml (This command will deploy product from internet but will read our values.yaml file during helm deployment)


######################## RBAC(roll based access controll)############################################
In this chapter we will create service account and will do rolebinding to provide acess their limitation.

1.users: its is kubernets administrator,generally they dont work from kubernetes master node in production environment,so we need to  give access from other servers. API user allowe based on Certificate based and secondly external authentication.

a.certificate based authentication
==================================
1. on one linux node(bastion node) create a user with jeff then go on master node for create certificate for authenticate user jeff
useradd jeff
passwd jeff
#install kubectl command on this bastion node.  yum install kubectl
#kubectl get pod ( this command will not work unless auth is not setup from cluster API)
2. on master node run following command:
Note: you need to sign all certificate of user using kubernetes ca.crt which exist on path which is /etc/kubernetes/pki/ca.crt
mkdir certs && cd certs
cp -av /etc/kubernetes/pki/ca.crt .
cp -av /etc/kubernetes/pki/ca.key .
Note: normal user need private key, CSR and certificate.
#openssl genrsa -out jeff.key 2048
#openssl req -new -key jeff.key -out jeff.csr -subj "CN=jeff/O=qa"  ( cn should same as user name and O can be the name of namespace)
#openssl x509 -req -in jeff.csr -CA ca.crt -CAkey ca.key -CAcreateserial -out jeff.crt -days 365
# rm -rf jeff.csr ca.srl ca.key
#ls
ca.crt jeff.crt jeff.key ( never shared these certificate to user, make config file as below process)
# cp -av /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf jeff.conf
#vim jeff.conf
apiVersion: v1
clusters:
 - cluster:
    certificate-authority-data: < paste here base64 out of ca.crt as given in below command>
    server:https://172.31.15.196:6443
  name:kubernetes
contexts:
 - context:
    cluster: kubernetes
    user: jeff
   name: jeff@kubernetes
current-context: jeff@kubernetes
kind: Config
preferences: {}
users:
- name: jeff
  user:
    client-certificate-data: < paste here jeff certificate base64 word out put here from below command>
    client-key-data: < paste here private key word output from below command>

#cat ca.crt |base64 -w0 < these command convert output to base64 in single word format>
#cat jeff.key|base64 -w0
#cat jeff.crt|base64 -w0

# when you put output of above commands in jeff.conf file then scp this file to bastion node and put into .kube/config directory inside home directory.
#kubectl get node < command will throw permission error, becasue if dont delegate any role to this user till yet)




2.roles: set of access rule in api.
a. defualt roles
b.custom roles

type of role scope
====================
a. Cluster level
b. NameSapce level
#kubectl get clusterrole ( this command is used to get cluster level roles in kubernetes cluster)
#kubect get role -n default ( this command is used get role detail in specific namespace)


3.rolebinding: when you deletegate role to user, its called rolebinding.
types of rolebinding scope

Note: Cluster level scope role can bind on cluster level binding as well on name space level binding. but namespace scope level role can bind on name space level binding.

a.cluster level
b.name space level


example1: we are going existing cluster level role to jeff.
#kubect create clusterrolebinding test-admin(name) --clusterrole=cluster-admin --user=jeff
#kubectl get clusterrolebinding|grep test
#kubectl describe clusterrolebinding test-admin

#kubectl delete clusterrolebinding test-admin

example: we are going to to allow cluster level scope to namespace
#kubectl create rolebinding test-admin --clusterrole=admin --user=jeff -n webprod
#kubectl get rolebinding -n webprod
#kubectl delete rolebinding test-admin -n webprod

#how to create custome role

5.describe


#kubectl create clusterrole pod-reader --resource=pod --verb=list ( creating cluster level role)
#kubectl create role pod-reader1 --resource=pod --verb=list -n webprod ( crearting name space leve role)
#kubectl create rolebinding test --role=pod-reader1 --user=jeff -n webprod ( binding name space role to user jeff for name space webprod)

#kubectl get clusterrole cluster-admin
#kubectl edit role pod-reader1 -n webprod1
#kubectl get clusterrole cluster-admin -o yaml > cluster-admin.yaml ( you can modify yaml to make new roles)

vim cluster-admin.yaml




4.Service account: This account is used by cluster service which will take the data information from API, so for that we create service account. For example prometheus is a service which need information from cluster so we need to create sevice account and provide access to get cluster level informations.

#creation service account
kubectl create sa xyz -n webprod

#role delegation on service account
kubectl create rolebinding test-servicebinding --clusterrole=admin --serviceaccount=webprod(namesapce):xyz(serviceaccountname) -n webprod
#inject service account in deployment.yaml

spec:
 ServiceAccount: xyz

################################### STATELESS and STATEFULL and HEADLESS DEPLOYMENT##################################
stateless deployment: if we have multiple replica for a deployment and there is no master slave concept then this type method is called stateless deployment. front end application come under this cateogry. we used replicaset, replication controller and deployment for launching stateless deployment.  pods under this deployment not having dependencies on other pods which are running on other service.In Stateless deployment we used common volume for each replica of deployment.


statefullset: StatefulSet keeps a unique identity for each pod it manages. It uses the same identity whenever it needs to reschedule those pods.

Headless: headless is nothing ,this is service for IP, instead of IP we use the name conventions for stop the spin traffic.


example: statefullset & headless

############################## SECRET and CONFIG MAP################################
secrets types:
a. generic
b. tls

#kubectl create secret generic super-secret<name of secret> --from-literal=myusername=ram --from-literal=mypass=redhat
#kubectl get secret
#kubectl edit secrets
#kubect get secret -o yaml super-secret
#echo <base64value from above output>|base64 -d

================================================================
there are two ways to map secret in deployment
a. as a environment variable: literal types of secret used in to this.
b. as a volume: TLS and Certificates mapped using volume.

mysql.yaml for mapping of secret which we created in above commands( literal)

apiVersion: app/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: null
  labels:
    app:tst
    name:tst
spec:
   replicas: 1
   selector:
      matchLabels:
         app:tst
   strategy: {}
   template:
     metadata:
       creationTimestamp: null
       lables:

            name: mysql
            env:
              - name:MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
                valueFrom:
                      secretKeyRef:
                                name:super-secret
                                key:mypass

#kubectl create -f mysql.yaml
#kubectl exct -it <podname> /bin/bash
#mysql -u root -p


TLS secret
=============
mkdir certs
openssl genrsa -out example.key 2048
openssl req -new -key example.key -out example.csr -subj "/c=US/ST=CA/L=Los Angeless/O=Example/OU=IT/CN=test.example.com"
openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in example.csr -signkey example.key -out example.crt

kubectl create secret tls mysecret --cert=certs/example.crt  --key=certs/example.key

#use of TLS certificate in pod.
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: mypod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: mypod
    image: redis
    volumeMounts:
    - name: foo
      mountPath: "/etc/foo"
      readOnly: true
  volumes:
  - name: foo
    secret:
      secretName: mysecret

configmap
============
configmap is same as secret and hold is value in text form while secret hold value in encrypted ( base64) form.

#kubectl create configmap super-configmap --from-literal=db-serverip=192.168.1.3:3306
#kubectl get configmap
#kubect get configmap super-configmap -o yaml
#vim nginx.conf ( change your changes in nginx such as TLS certificate and keys which you made earlier)
#kubectl create configmap nginx-configmap --from-file=nginx.conf
Note: If file is loaded in configmap then we dont need this file on node servers.

###how to use configmap###########
there are two ways to use configmap in deployment same as secret.
a. if configmap/secret have values store then we need to use environment variable during deployment for calling them.
b. if configmap/secret have file store then we need to mount them as volume in deployment.

example of environment variable:
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx-test
spec:
  containers:
    - name: test-container
      image: nginx
      envFrom:
          - configMapRef:
               name: super-configmap
          
  restartPolicy: Never

#kubectl exec -it nginx-test /bin/bash
#env ( this command will show environment vairiable which we store in configmap named super-configmap.

Note: in above example we are passing both key and value store in configmap named super-configmap, what if we want to pass only value in DB-SERVER environment variable during deployment.

exampel2: this example ingest value of configmap named super-configmap in DB_HOST environment value.

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx-test
spec:
  containers:
    - name: test-container
      image: nginx
      env:
        # Define the environment variable
        - name: DB_HOST
          valueFrom:
            - configMapKeyRef:
                name: super-configmap
                key:  db-serverip
          
  restartPolicy: Never


######using nginx file in deployment which is store in configmap named nginx-configmap#####


example yaml file
##################
apiVersion: v1

        # to add to the container
        name: nginx-configmap
  restartPolicy: Never



##################### Monitoring ###########################################
Resource Monitoring: prometheus( for gathering data metrics) & Grafana ( for visulize prometheus data)
Logs Monitoring: ELK( elasticsearch,logstash,kibana) and EFK(elasticsearch,fluented,kibana)

####installation of prometheus and Grafana using helm######

kubectl create ns monitoring
helm repo add prometheus-community https://prometheus-community.github.io/helm-charts
helm search repo prometheus-community
helm install prometheus(cutomname) prometheus-community/prometheus -n monitoring

kubectl get po -n monitoring
kubectl get deploy -n monitoring
kubectl get pvc -n monitoring
kubectl get service -n monitoring ( notedown ip address of prometheus-server)
kubectl edit service prometheus-server otional:-if goes with grafana(change Type ClusterIP to NodePort to access from outside and in ports section give nodePort: 30001 just after targetPort:9090).

then open prometheus using http://serviceip:nodeport

Now install Grafana
===============
helm repo add grafana https://grafana.github.io/helm-charts
helm search repo grafana
helm install grafana-webui(custom name) grafana/grafana -n monitoring
kubectl get pod -n monitoring
kubectl get service -n monitoring ( notedown ip address of grafana)
kubectl edit service grafana (change Type ClusterIP to NodePort to access from outside and in ports section give nodePort: 30002 just after targetPort:3000)

access grafana from browser: http://serviceip-of-grafana:30002

###get the password of grafana ui####
kubectl get secret -n monitoring
kubectl get secret grafana -o yaml -n monitoring

#notedown encrypted value of user and password from output of above command then run following command
echo -n <value of username> |base64 -d
echo -n <value of password>|base64 -d

Note: After successfully login integrate prometheus with grafana usin url http://prometheus-serviceip



EFK(elasticsearch,fluented,kibana) INSTALLATION

#####how to create PV using Hostpath####################################
In Hostpath we make a directory on worker node and use that directory in POD using HostPath option... This is used only used for readonly files which we need to mount on pod so we can say it use read-only mode.

example:
sudo mkdir /mnt/data
sudo sh -c "echo 'Hello from Kubernetes storage' > /mnt/data/index.html"


vim hostpath-pv.yaml
====================
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: task-pv-volume
  labels:
    type: local
spec:
  storageClassName: manual
  capacity:
    storage: 10Gi
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  hostPath:
    path: "/mnt/data"
#kubectl create -f hostpath-pv.yaml

vim hostpath-pvc.yaml
======================
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: task-pv-claim
spec:
  storageClassName: manual === This class name should same which we gave during PV creation.
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 3Gi

#kubectl create -f hostpath-pvc.yaml
kubectl get pv task-pv-volume
kubectl get pvc task-pv-claim

Usig PVC in POD using  pod.yaml
===============================
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: task-pv-pod
spec:
  volumes:
    - name: task-pv-storage
      persistentVolumeClaim:
        claimName: task-pv-claim=== This name should be same which we give during PVC creation...
  containers:
    - name: task-pv-container
      image: nginx
      ports:
        - containerPort: 80
          name: "http-server"
      volumeMounts:
        - mountPath: "/usr/share/nginx/html"
          name: task-pv-storage

#kubectl create -f pod.yaml
#kubectl get pod
kubectl exec -it task-pv-pod -- /bin/bash
apt update
apt install curl
curl http://localhost/



Note: you can use use local path and hostpath both to mount local folder in pod.. but difference is in hostpath we dont need to create folder in hostpath, it will create automatically but in local we need to create directory manually. In local type we need to define affinty[from which node we are having local folder which we will use].  Dynamic provisioning not supported to local volume method.

####local volume example###################

go on worker node2 and craete a directory /op/application then use following yaml file..

######################################### POD vs Containers & Init Container & Static POD##############################

1. Multicontainer Pod:  pod containes containers such as nginx, redis etc.multicontainer pod dont use for HA,scalability, No load spin accross container inside pod. We can run multiple container in one container. Multicontainer pod have single IP. all container running inside a pod will use 127.0.0.1:port to each other. containers running inside single pod  can share volumen and network.

command to go specific container
==============================
kubectl exec -it <pod name> -c <container-name> /bin/bash


2. Init Container: 
Init containers always run to completion.
Each init container must complete successfully before the next one starts

3. Static Pod-- discuss with Rajesh.....
Static Pods are managed directly by the kubelet daemon on a specific node, without the API server observing them. Unlike Pods that are managed by the control plane (for example, a Deployment); instead, the kubelet watches each static Pod (and restarts it if it fails).

#NOTE: Need to check bash completion for kubernets cluster
